Privacy Policy – PDF Studio

Company: NSB Solutions Pvt Ltd
Updated On: November 5, 2025

We do not collect, store, or sell personal data. There is no sign-in and we keep no server database.

Your files are processed locally on your device. Conversions, edits, encryption/decryption, and template generation all run on-device.

No accounts, no cloud, no analytics, no ads.

Permissions are requested only to perform core features (e.g., reading/saving files or picking images).

You control what you create, open, export, share, rename, or delete.

What the App Does

PDF Studio provides on-device tools including Text-to-PDF, Image-to-PDF, Split, Merge, and PDF Encryption/Decryption.
It includes a PDF editor and a “Create PDF” section with simple templates (applications, certificates, and CVs), with more templates and features planned.
All operations are performed locally on your device.

App Permissions & Why We Ask

Storage / Photos & Media — to browse, open, and save documents (e.g., converting text/images to PDF, splitting/merging, exporting edited PDFs).

Manage external storage (Android, only when required) — some devices/versions need this to write to common folders like Downloads.

You can decline permissions, but related features may not work.
You can change permissions anytime in device settings.
The app does not upload your files or passwords; encryption/decryption runs on-device.

Children’s Privacy

PDF Studio is a general-purpose utility app and does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children.
Because we don’t collect data at all, there is nothing for us to store or sell.

Changes to This Policy

If we introduce features that change how data is handled (for example, optional cloud backups), we will update this policy and explain the changes in-app and/or on our store listing.
Your continued use after the updated effective date means you accept the new terms.
